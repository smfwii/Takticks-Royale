As promised, I uploaded my enrichment seminar project to github. You should be able to open it in the unity editor. I plan to continue working on this myself. Here are the current plans:

-Switch to using the network lobby manager (done)

-Make a custom GUI for creating and joining matches (the default one is just ugly)

-Figure out what is causing the syncing issues between the host and the client (done for now)

Once these are done, I'll get back to adding new features. If you have any ideas, please tell me.
